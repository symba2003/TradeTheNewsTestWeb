Modify the existing ASP.NET application form, so that it will send data to the server via AJAX. 
You can use any Javascript framework of your choise (JQuery, etc.). 
Data must be validated on the server (not empty name, color is selected, etc.).
If the sent data is valid, the application must show a page with entered data.
